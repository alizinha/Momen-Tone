# Access Code 2.1 Final Project Proposal

App: **Momen-Tone**  
Team: **SoundShakes**  
Team Members: **Tasha Smith, George Syrimis, John Gomez, Jorge Reina**  

## The Problem 

Listening to the same music can become boring and repetitive after a while, either you look for new music you like or you must create your own. 
Many of the music apps that try to create a theme or playlist of music for you are either riddled with ads unless you pay for them, or loop around the same playlist without adding new content until you start changing your preferences, which can get old fast.
One way to solve the problem is to make your own music, but most people don't know to, nor do they want to learn. Even those that do, must go through a steep learning curve.

There are apps currently in the market that make music which are geared towards either proffessionals and hold a steep learning curve, or are incredibly simple and gimmicky to be useful. 
User base would be mainly audio artists or anyone interested in exploring soundscapes when it comes to creating their own music but have neither the time to learn how to or have not found an application that does it well. 
It its noteworthy to mention that we want to make it so that a child would be able to play with the app and hopefully explore and learn not only about music but also be inspired by the technology that goes into making it while also thinking about the physics behind the functionality of our app. 

## The Solution 
The application attemps to solve the problem by providing the user with a motion based digital sequencer that creates dynamically pleasing sounds for the user based on device movement and user interaction. 
Our application will attempt to bridge the usefulness gap by giving the user an intuitive way to interact with their music without having to know music theory and without it feeling like its a toy.
A visualizer will add a degree of depth to the sound and a pleasing and easy to use UI will make sure that the user enjoys their experience with the app. 

### Baseline Features (By Demo 1)
  *  Detects breakpoints in the accelerometer data to insert digital sounds to create music, like when you're walking or running. The Idea being that the sound generated harmonizes in tempo/pitch based on time/distance the accelerometer detects movement. 
  *  The ability to elegantly randomize the music it makes so that it sounds consistent but never the same.  
  *  The ability to Save performances onto the device. 
  
### Bonus features
  *  If completed on time we would like to add the ability to record and program your own sounds to include into the mix. 
  *  The ability to choose different musical styles aside from a digial sequencer (jazz,hip-hop, latin, etc). 
  *  Gracefully/successfully transitioning between different musical styles.

## Execution

###Sprint Cycle
| Week | Date | Sprint | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Week 1 | 8/3-8/9  | Ideation and feasibility |
| Week 2 | 8/10-8/16 | Research, wireframing and baseline technical specs. Begin visualizer, sequencer work, and UI. |
| Week 3 | 8/17-8/23 | Finish baseline implementation (Working data input and analog output system) and visualizer |
| Week 4 | 8/24-8/30 | Finalize UI streamlining UX |
| Week 5 | 8/31-9/6 | First release demo, gauge user reaction, user testing, implement new features |
| Week 6 | 9/7-9/13 | Second release. New features, Implenmented feedback (if any) |
| Week 7 | Tue Sep 15, 7pm | Final Demo Day |

## Team Responsabilities

### Tash:
  
  * UI, Will build out Material design implementation that creates a pleasant experience for the user and will work with other team members to maintain consistency throughout the app.
  Will also work on the Visualizer.
  
### Jorge:
  
  * Will work with John to build Sequencer and user interaction with it. Will help build UI elements and work with tash on visualizer.
  
### John:
  
  * Will work with Jorge to build Sequencer and with George to build the system that translates data to analog sound.
  
### George:

  * Will build with John digital-analog system helping with debugging and maintaining our group on track. 
  
**Every member of the team will have some kind of input on each member's part to ensure overall communication and collaboration within the team.**
