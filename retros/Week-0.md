# Week-0 Momen-Tone retro. 

##notes:

This week the team settled on an Idea we all agreed on. One member of our team was not able to make it to class today but he made it clear beforehand that he was willing to work with us.

Our success this week was laying down a plan for what we want to make. Laying a foundation for how to approach it.

We fell behind on the ideation. We should have had a wireframe by now but since our app is mainly feature driven that is not a huge setback.

This week our goals are to prototype a minimum working version of our features and have the file set up to work mainly on UI and UX for the week after.
