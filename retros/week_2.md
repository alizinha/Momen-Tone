## Weekly Retro week 2  

**Goals for last Sprint**:

Multithreading the tones
Get basic background UI

**Goals for this Sprint**:

Basic ground implementation of mvp however basic

**Guiding Questions** (consider before the meeting):

  *  What went well?
      We got interesting waveforms and were able to change their characteristics by overlaying them on top of each other.
  *  What should we do differently next time?
      A planned design for a wireframe would have helped in building this out but without the knowledge gained it was impossible.
  *  What did we learn?
      Characteristics of waveforms and how to modulate them. Different parts of sound synthesis.
  *  What still puzzles us?
      What is the best way to map out sensor data and it's influence over the waveforms we're generating
 
**Team Member Analysis**:
If you did not meet your goals, how will this affect the progression of the product? What will you do differently to meet your goals this week?
We have been doing a lot fo research but the omplementation has been slow. This week we'll work on putting together a basic form of what we've learned.
  *  John
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week:
        * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not?
            Find new sound forms, triangle, square, saw, noise. : Met
    * Goals/Responsibilities This Week:
    Work with george to implement a working basic version of the app.
  *  Tasha    
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week:
         * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not?
               Merge AudioTrack with SoundPool. Work on threading and multiple sounds at once. : Met
               We found out that all we need to do is layer different instances of Audiotrack, SoundPool seems unecessary.
    * Goals/Responsibilities This Week:
              Work on onboarding for new users.
  *  Jorge
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week:
        * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not?
              Build background UI. :Partially.
              We needed more info on how we were going to lay out the user experience which we laid down on the weekend.
              Logo and splash screen were created.
    * Goals/Responsibilities This Week:
              Work on improving the user interface and work with tasha to make sure theyre on the same page.
  *  George
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week:
       * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not?
             Manage team to meet deadlines. Quality check threading and new sound forms.
    * Goals/Responsibilities This Week:
            Work with John to build basic implementation of the back end. 
**Additional Discussion Topics**:

  *  Compare your work planned with what your work completed. 
      We did learned a lot this week in terms of what we can build and how we can build it.
  *  Is the divison of roles within your team working?
      We have had our hiccups but it all seems to be working.
  *  How is communication and collaboration between team members?
      Good.
  *  Are you getting adequate support? How are you reviewing code?
     We are pair porgraming when possible and we consult each other on important decisions, we spoke to john and he helped us understand how we can set 
     up threading as best he could, not it is up to us to make it work.
  *  How can you improve productivity and get the most work done within the next week?
     We've begun to pair program through google hangouts and have focused on getting the bare bones of what is needed for the app to work.
